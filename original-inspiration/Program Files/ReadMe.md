The goal of this project is to style Mozilla Firefox to resemble Netscape Navigator.

Uploaded for reference purposes is a complete install of Netscape Navigator 9. 
Netscape relied heavily on JAVA (.jar) file containers (Java ARchive) to style and manage the user interface. 
Within many of those files were CSS files and image files (png, gif, etc.).  
They have been extracted, and their directors are labeled with the ending phrase --js

While the install files "as is" have been included in this repository for reference purposes, they will not be included in any current or future releases.

NOTE: This ReadMe.dm file along with the folders (directories) ending with "--jar" are not directly part of the Netscape Navigator install. 
Although, the directories (folders) ending with "--jar" are directly associated. 

Netscape relied heavily on JAVA (.jar) file containers (Java ARchive) to style and manage the user interface. 
Within many of those files were CSS files and image files (png, gif, etc.).  
They have been extracted, and their directors (folders) are labeled with the ending phrase --jar
